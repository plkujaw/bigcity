# bigcity

HTML/CSS excercise - to create a website based only on a Photoshop layout:

![Bigcity Layout](/layout.png)

Live website:

[living in a big city](https://plkujaw.github.io/bigcity/index.html)

Used 'mobile-first' approach - styled everything for small screens first and then for a bigger screens.
