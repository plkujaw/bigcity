# Big City

The task is to create a functioning website based only on a Photoshop design/layout.

For responsive design I used 'mobile-first' approach - styled website for a small screens first and then for a bigger screens.
Used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Jest for unit testing.

Live website: </br>

To run the tests:
- clone this repository
- navigate to the root folder of the project
- install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest`
- run `npm test`

Basic layout: </br>
